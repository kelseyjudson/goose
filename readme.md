Goose Software Suite
====================

Goose is a planned badminton software suite for tournament draws/results/entries etc. As I am frequently frustrated by "Tournament Planner", and would like to create a free, simple, logical web based interface.

Requires gems: sinatra, haml, rdiscount and sqlite3.
