# Goose

## What?

Goose is a planned badminton software suite, intended as a
simple alternative to Tournament Planner for smaller local
tournaments where Tournament Planner might be overkill.

It will be self-hosted (so you can run it on a cheap VPS
service), and free to use and modify.

## When?

I'm not sure when I'll get around to building this, if ever,
but it's something I'm motivated to do at some point as I feel
smaller clubs/associations need all the help they can get and
if the ready availability of tools like this make things just a
little bit easier, and a little bit more fun, then it's well
worth the effort!
